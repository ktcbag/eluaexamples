## This is the eLua Examples Code Repository ##

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The contents of this repo were moved to github. The basic examples are kept at https://github.com/elua/examples. The more advanced examples are being kept in independent projects at the same root/organization **eLua** at https://github.com/elua

It is possible that we maintain an svn mirror here in the future but this is NOT being done at the moment. For updated versions of the code previously maintained here, please refer to the links above.


**eLua** is an Open Source project that brings the [Lua](http://www.lua.org) programming language to the world of microcontrollers, in a very portable way. **eLua** also allows you to develop and run full applicatons on targets with no need for an OS below.

The **eLua** Project is hosted at http://www.eluaproject.net

Welcome to **eLua**

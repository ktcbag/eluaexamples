This is more complex, but also very important for eLua, because it proves that real time applications (with relatively strict timing requirements) can run from eLua directly. It's the famous TV-B-Gone project adapted from LadyAda's kit. If you're not familiar with TV-B-Gone, it knows how to do one thing very well: power off your TV :) 

Basically it contains a lot of remote control codes (for a lot of TVs) that are continuously sent via an IR LED. This code uses the PWM module (new in eLua 0.4) and it also does file I/O from Lua, since the remote control codes are kept in a separate file (which is also part of the ROM file system). To read the binary file, the "pack" module (also new in 0.4) is used. To ensure that we don't get any unexpected delays, the Lua garbage collector is turned off. Take a look at this sample, it's both a very good proof of the capabilities of eLua and a good learning resource.

To use it on EK-LM3S8962 or EK-LM3S6965 connect an IR LED with a resistor between the "PWM2" and "GND" pins of the extension connector. Get close to your TV and press the "select" button on your board to start sending the IR codes. The on-board LED stays lit while the codes are transmitted and shuts off afterwards. Press the "down" button on your board to exit the application and return to the shell.
